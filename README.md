# Federal Acquisition API
This is a project of mine to create a local API specific with federal acquisition data. Although [gsa.gov](http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/index.html) has a great many API's, I wanted to create some smaller-scale API's just to get my hands on the data that's out there and presented by GSA yet.

Currently, these projects amount to creating API's for the following:
- SBA Small Business Size Standards
- VETS-4212 Registrations

For more information on each of these projects, please consult the README in each of the respective folders.
